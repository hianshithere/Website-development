Overview


It is seen many a times that due to the fear of confronting a police officer while registering a complaint or going to a police station
for doing the same, they feel uncomfortable and sometimes shy. One more reason that a person feels uncomfortable in registering a
complaint is due to the aftermath of the complaint. We have also seen sometimes police officers extend their help up to some extent that
leads to many of the crimes unnoticed and the perpetrator walks freely on the street. This results in an unmanaged system which 
unknowingly has flaws in it. Some of the reasons where a criminal activity goes unnoticed by the system is one of the flaws, which results
in huge increase in crime rate. To overcome few of these flaws an online crime management system is developed within this project.
The main focus of this project is to encourage citizens to let them register for those criminal activities that normally they would have
not registered under few unfavorable circumstances that include society or family pressure. The objective of this project focusses on 
reducing the hassle of a citizen to register a complaint which in turn will help the police to work better and in more efficient way,
which in turn will reduce the criminal rate that upraises due to negligence that follows through not registering a complaint. If a citizen
wants he can create a personal account and login to the account anytime from anywhere they want to lodge a complaint or he can register his complaint.
