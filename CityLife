(Sharing your travel experience)


ABSTRACT

How many times people think of visiting to Kolkata but they cannot as they don’t have the appropriate information about the place and if they do, it’s scattered all over the internet.
This website is made for those people who like to travel or are thinking of visiting Kolkata as a part of their vacation, but due to lack of information in one place they cannot travel or decide their whereabouts in the city or maybe share the experience with others. This website benefits the user in two ways. Firstly, if a person is planning to travel to Kolkata, with our website not only the user gets the detailed information about the places to visit, but also gets the relevant information like, nearby places worth visiting and more. Secondly, if a user register, he/she will become a dedicated member and would have access to a lot more content than just visitors; moreover, the members would get full support from our team via our query dedicated email channel. This Web project is mainly a visit planner and a travel guide to Kolkata, which has user(s) personal experience(s) shared with other registered members of this website.
